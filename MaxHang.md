# MaxHang is a terminal application created for climbers to input, store and retrieve their scores on a Max Hang test.
The user will be prompted when running the application to input their details if they are a new user. Otherwise, if they are an existing user they will be retrieved from the users.csv file.
The test will score the user based off of a percentage of their bodyweight.The user will be required to input their bodyweight as well as the added weight in any given testing session. The percentage score calculated from this. It calculates the score as - their total bodyweight = 100% and added weight would be in excess of this. For example if the user is 50kg and the add 50kgs and manage to successfully hang for 7secs they would score 200%.
